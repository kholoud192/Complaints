  <h2>International Investment Authority (IIA)</h2>
  <p>
    The International Investment Authority (IIA) is the official regulatory body entrusted with the oversight, supervision, and governance of financial brokerage firms and investment platforms on a global scale. Operating under a strict legal and regulatory framework, the IIA ensures full compliance with international financial laws, investor protection mandates, and market integrity protocols.
  </p>

  <h3>Regulatory Mandate & Jurisdiction</h3>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h4>1. Licensing, Accreditation & Regulatory Oversight</h4>
    <p>
      The IIA serves as the sole competent authority responsible for issuing official financial operating licenses to brokerage firms, investment intermediaries, and financial service providers. Stringent due diligence, risk assessments, and compliance evaluations are conducted to ensure adherence to legally binding financial regulations and market conduct requirements.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h4>2. Investor Fund Protection & Segregation Compliance</h4>
    <p>
      All IIA-accredited entities are legally required to maintain full segregation of client assets from corporate accounts, in accordance with financial governance mandates. This ensures absolute asset protection, mitigating risks associated with insolvency, misappropriation, or unauthorized fund access.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h4>3. Market Surveillance, Risk Management & Fraud Prevention</h4>
    <p>
      The IIA conducts continuous regulatory surveillance to detect, prevent, and mitigate risks associated with market manipulation, insider trading, fraudulent investment schemes, and financial misconduct. Violations are subject to legal enforcement actions, including license suspension, regulatory sanctions, asset freezing orders, and criminal prosecution where applicable.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h4>4. Investor Grievance Redressal & Dispute Resolution Mechanisms</h4>
    <p>
      The IIA provides a government-recognized dispute resolution framework, enabling investors to lodge formal complaints against licensed financial institutions. All disputes are adjudicated under binding regulatory procedures, with a mandate to enforce financial restitution, compliance rectification, or legal accountability measures as necessary.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h4>5. Enforcement Against Unauthorized Financial Operators</h4>
    <p>
      Entities engaged in financial activities without official authorization from the IIA are subject to immediate regulatory intervention, including cease-and-desist orders, judicial proceedings, and market exclusion directives. The IIA collaborates with law enforcement agencies, international regulatory bodies, and financial intelligence units (FIUs) to combat illicit financial activities and cross-border investment fraud.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>Ensuring Financial Stability, Investor Confidence & Market Integrity</h3>
  <p>
    As the legally mandated global financial regulatory authority, the IIA upholds the highest standards of financial governance, ensuring the integrity, transparency, and security of the international investment ecosystem. Our supervisory jurisdiction over four of the world’s leading trading platforms guarantees a structured, compliant, and investor-centric financial environment.
